Hey everyone:smile:, as you can see by the title. This is a script which generates images with the help of gemini, google's AI. <br>
To run this script, all you need is to create a API Key from <br>

Now create a environmental variable called "API_Key" with it's value as the generated API key<br>
Instructions on how to create a environmental variable can be found in the below link<br>

Finally, you need to import generate_image.py script and call generate_image function as shown in below code sniplet:
```python
from generate_image import generate_image
generate_image(prompt)
```
